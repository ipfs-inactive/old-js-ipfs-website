## Internationalization `i18n`

### Incorrect translation, help us fix it!

- 1. Create a [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/signup/?join_project=js-ipfs-website) account
- 2. Go to https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-website/, select a language, find an invalid string and propose a new translation

### Missing language? Help us translate!

Everyone can help by translating content at Transifex:

- Go to https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-website and start translating.
- If your language is missing request it on Transifex.


### Synchronizing translations (maintainer task)

Periodically, a maintainer of this repo will need to synchronize translations to ensure everything is up to date.  
**NOTE: The steps below are for admins and can be ignored if you're a translator; all translation work happens in Transifex only.**

To download updates of all locales:
```console
$ tx pull -a
```

Then check if any language is missing in the file [intl/config](intl/config.js), if so, add a line for missing one. 

For example, if you were to add Portuguese, you would only have to add the new language to the `locales` array:

```diff
const locales = [
 'en',
+ 'pt'
```

Then, to download updates of specific locale:
```console
$ tx pull -l pt
```

Finally, commit changes to `./src/i18n.js` and `public/locales/`.

**Note:** Newly added language(s) will be live at [js.ipfs.io](https://js.ipfs.io/) as soon as the `master` branch is updated.

## Listing a talk on the website

You can add your talk to the website by creating a PR. You just need to add an object to the [`publicationsAndTalks`](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/blob/master/src/shared/data/publications-and-talks/index.js) array. Example, if you were to add a new entry, you would have to add the `link` to your talk and its `title`:

```js
const publicationsAndTalks = [
  {
    link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK4PIGr3RB8',
    active: true,
    title: 'Progress Report on the Decentralized Web, David Dias'
  },
  {
    link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cmbm6iABsI',
    title: 'IPFS on the Brave Browser, Alan Shaw'
  }
]
```

## Want to show what's possible to build with `js-ipfs`?

Sharing your app with us is very simple! You just need to host your code on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) and edit [`apps` array](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/blob/master/src/shared/data/what-you-can-build/index.js). Example, if you want to add a new app, you only have to add a new entry to the `apps` array by adding its title and the corresponding `codesandbox` share link:

```js
const apps = [
  {
    title: 'Example 1',
    link: 'https://codesandbox.io/embed/qkj8z9l8kq'
  },
  {
    title: 'Example 2',
    link: 'https://codesandbox.io/embed/vv99onw18y'
  }
]
```
