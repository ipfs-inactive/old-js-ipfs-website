# [js.ipfs.io](https://js.ipfs.io)

> The js-ipfs Project Website.

This project builds out a static website for js-ipfs, available at [js.ipfs.io](https://js.ipfs.io/), to explain the JavaScript implementation of the IPFS protocol. It uses [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to generate the HTML pages.
It provides an informative, public-facing website. The most important things are the concepts, links, and examples that are provided.
Most of the website content is data-driven, you can check [data](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/tree/master/src/shared/data) dir to see sections information bundled as `js` files.

## Development

### Install
```sh
> git clone https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io
> npm install
```

### Usage
The following commands are available:

#### **npm run develop**
It will start a hot-reloading development environment at [localhost:8000](localhost:8000).

#### **npm run build**
It will generate static HTML and JavaScript code bundles by performing a production build.

#### **npm run lint**
It runs [aegir](https://github.com/ipfs/aegir) lint.

## Deployment
When a branch gets `merged` to master, it is deployed to [dev.js.ipfs](https://dev.js.ipfs.io/).
To deploy to [js.ipfs.io](https://js.ipfs.io/) the code should be merged into the `production` branch.

**Important:** Before each deploy you need to add and pin the website on IPFS. Then add the hash to each translation file. Thus, you must:
1. build the project
```sh
> npm run build
```
2. Init your `ipfs` daemon
```sh
> ipfs init
```
3. add `public` folder to `ipfs`:
```sh
> ipfs add -r public/
added <resulting-hash>
```
4. pin the website on `ipfs`:
```
> ipfs pin add -r /ipfs/<resulting-hash>
```
After that, go to [messages](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/tree/master/intl/messages) folder and paste the resulting hash on `serviceWorker` object. Note that all `json` files must be updated. Example:
```
"serviceWorker": {
    ...
        "activationSuccessText": "(...)js.ipfs.io - /ipfs/<resulting-hash>](https://js.ipfs.io/ipfs/<resulting-hash>\n(...)"
    ...
}
```

**Note:** This process will be automated as soon as we tackle [this](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/issues/171) issue.

## Translations

### Invalid translation?
1. [Create Transifex account](https://www.transifex.com/signup/?join_project=js-ipfs-website)
2. Go to https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-website/, select language, find invalid string and propose a new translation

### Missing language? Help us translate!
You can do it in 2 steps:

#### 1. Create a PR that adds a line to the config with new language code.
In the file [intl/config](intl/config.js), add a line for your language. Example, if you were to add Portuguese to:

```
module.exports = {
  defaultLocale: 'en',
  availableLocales: [
    { acronym: 'en', fullForm: 'English' }
  ]
}
```

You would only have to add the new language to the availableLocales array:

```
module.exports = {
  defaultLocale: 'en',
  availableLocales: [
    { acronym: 'en', fullForm: 'English' },
    { acronym: 'pt', fullForm: 'PortuguÃªs (PT)' }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Translate content at Transifex

- Go to https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-website and start translating.
- If your language is missing request it on Transifex or as an issue in this repo.
- To download and add translations to the PR:
```sh
  $ tx pull -l <lang>
  $ git add intl
  $ git commit
```
This step can be done by you or a person reviewing the PR. Replace `<lang>` with code added to `intl/config.js`

When you are finished, submit it as a PR to this repo. Once it gets merged into master it will be live at [dev.js.ipfs.io](https://dev.js.ipfs.io/). It will be live at [js.ipfs.io](https://js.ipfs.io/) as soon as `production` branch is updated.

<a name="talk"/>

## Add your talk to the website
You can add your talk to the website by creating a PR. You just need to add an object to [`publicationsAndTalks`](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/blob/master/src/shared/data/publications-and-talks/index.js) array. Example, if you were to add a new entry to:

```js
const publicationsAndTalks = [
  {
    link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK4PIGr3RB8',
    active: true,
    title: 'Progress Report on the Decentralized Web, David Dias'
  }
]
```

You would have to add the `link` to your talk and its `title`:
```js
const publicationsAndTalks = [
  {
    link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK4PIGr3RB8',
    active: true,
    title: 'Progress Report on the Decentralized Web, David Dias'
  },
  {
    link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cmbm6iABsI',
    title: 'IPFS on the Brave Browser, Alan Shaw'
  }
]
```

<a name="apps">

## Want to show what's possible to build with `js-ipfs`?
Sharing your app with us is very simple! You just need to host your code on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) and edit [`apps` array](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/blob/master/src/shared/data/what-you-can-build/index.js). Example, if you want to add a new app to:

```js
const apps = [
  {
    title: 'Example 1',
    link: 'https://codesandbox.io/embed/qkj8z9l8kq'
  }
]
```

You only have to add a new entry to the `apps` array by adding its title and the corresponding `codesandbox` share link:
```js
const apps = [
  {
    title: 'Example 1',
    link: 'https://codesandbox.io/embed/qkj8z9l8kq'
  },
  {
    title: 'Example 2',
    link: 'https://codesandbox.io/embed/vv99onw18y'
  }
]
```
