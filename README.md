# [js.ipfs.io](https://js.ipfs.io) - The js-ipfs project Website.

Welcome to the js.ipfs.io Website repo. This website uses [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Most of the website content is data-driven, you can check the [data](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/tree/master/src/shared/data) directory to see the sections information bundled as `js` files.

## Internationalization `i18n`

### Incorrect translation, help us fix it!

- 1. Create a [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/signup/?join_project=js-ipfs-website) account
- 2. Go to https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-website/, select a language, find an invalid string and propose a new translation

### Missing language? Help us translate!

You can do it in 2 steps:

**1. Create a PR that adds a line to the config file with a new language code**

In the file [intl/config](intl/config.js), add a line for your language. Example, if you were to add Portuguese, you would only have to add the new language to the `availableLocales` array:

```
module.exports = {
  defaultLocale: 'en',
  availableLocales: [
    { acronym: 'en', fullForm: 'English' },
    { acronym: 'pt', fullForm: 'PortuguÃªs' }
  ]
}
```

**2. Translate content at Transifex**

- Go to https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-website and start translating.
- If your language is missing request it on Transifex or as an issue in this repo.
- To download and add translations to the PR:
```sh
  $ tx pull -l <lang>
  $ git add intl
  $ git commit
```
This step can be done by you or a person reviewing the PR. Replace `<lang>` with the code added to `intl/config.js`

When you are finished, submit it as a PR to this repo. Once it gets merged into master it will be live at [dev.js.ipfs.io](https://dev.js.ipfs.io/). It will be live at [js.ipfs.io](https://js.ipfs.io/) as soon as the `production` branch is updated.

## Listing a talk on the website

You can add your talk to the website by creating a PR. You just need to add an object to the [`publicationsAndTalks`](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/blob/master/src/shared/data/publications-and-talks/index.js) array. Example, if you were to add a new entry, you would have to add the `link` to your talk and its `title`:

```js
const publicationsAndTalks = [
  {
    link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK4PIGr3RB8',
    active: true,
    title: 'Progress Report on the Decentralized Web, David Dias'
  },
  {
    link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cmbm6iABsI',
    title: 'IPFS on the Brave Browser, Alan Shaw'
  }
]
```

## Want to show what's possible to build with `js-ipfs`?

Sharing your app with us is very simple! You just need to host your code on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) and edit [`apps` array](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/blob/master/src/shared/data/what-you-can-build/index.js). Example, if you want to add a new app, you only have to add a new entry to the `apps` array by adding its title and the corresponding `codesandbox` share link:

```js
const apps = [
  {
    title: 'Example 1',
    link: 'https://codesandbox.io/embed/qkj8z9l8kq'
  },
  {
    title: 'Example 2',
    link: 'https://codesandbox.io/embed/vv99onw18y'
  }
]
```

## Development

### Dependencies

- `gatsbyjs v2` to build the website
- `Node.js >= v10` and `npm` for build tools
- `Transifex Client` for locales
- `ipfs` to deploy changes

### Install

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io
> npm install
```

### Usage

The following commands are available:

- `npm run develop` - Starts a hot-reloading development environment at [localhost:8000](localhost:8000).
- `npm run build` - Generates the static HTML and JavaScript code bundles by performing a production build.
- `npm run lint` - Runs [aegir](https://github.com/ipfs/aegir) lint.

### Supported Browsers Versions

We are currently targeting:

| Browser       | Versions      |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Chrome        | >= 69         |
| Firefox       | >= 62         |
| Safari        | >= 11.1       |


## Publish

When a branch gets `merged` to master, it is deployed to [dev.js.ipfs](https://dev.js.ipfs.io/).

To deploy to [js.ipfs.io](https://js.ipfs.io/) the code should be merged into the `production` branch.

**Important:** Before a deploy you need to add the website to IPFS and update the resulting hash in each translation file. 
Thus, you must:
1. Build the project
```sh
> npm run build
```
2. Init your `ipfs` daemon (if you haven't done it before)
```sh
> ipfs init
```
3. Add the `public` folder to IPFS
```sh
> ipfs add -r public/
added <resulting-hash>
```

After that, go to the [messages](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/tree/master/intl/messages) folder and paste the resulting hash on the `serviceWorker` object. Note that all `json` files must be updated. Example:
```js
"serviceWorker": {
    ...
    "activationSuccessText": "(...)js.ipfs.io - /ipfs/<resulting-hash>](https://js.ipfs.io/ipfs/<resulting-hash>\n(...)"
    ...
}
```

**Note:** This process will be automated as soon as we tackle [this issue](https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/issues/171).
